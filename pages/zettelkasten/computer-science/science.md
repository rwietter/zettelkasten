# Glossary of Computer Science

## Mathematical foundations

- Coding theory: useful in networking, programming and other areas where computers communicate with each other.
- Discrete Mathematics.
- Graph theory: foundations for data structures and searching algorithms.
- Mathematical logic: boolean logic and other ways of modeling logical queries; the uses and limitations of formal proof methods.
- Number theory: theory of the integers. Used in cryptography as well as a test domain in artificial intelligence.

## Concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems

- Parallel computing: the theory and practice of simultaneous computation; data safety in any multitasking or multithreaded environment.
- Concurrency: computing using multiple concurrent threads of execution, devising algorithms for solving problems on multiple processors to achieve maximal speed-up compared to sequential execution.
- Distributed computing: computing using multiple computing devices over a network to accomplish a common objective or task and thereby reducing the latency involved in single processor contributions for any task.

## Databases

- Relational databases: the set theoretic and algorithmic foundation of databases.
- Structured Storage: non-relational databases such as NoSQL databases.

## Programming languages and compilers

- Compiler theory: theory of compiler design, based on Automata theory.
- Programming language theory (PLT): is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of formal languages known as programming languages and of their individual features.
- Formal semantics: rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programs.
- Type theory: formal analysis of the types of data, and the use of these types to understand properties of programs — especially program safety.

## Computer architecture

- Computer architecture: the design, organization, optimization and verification of a computer system, mostly about CPUs and Memory subsystem (and the bus connecting them).
- Operating systems: systems for managing computer programs and providing the basis of a usable system.

## Theory of computation

- Automata theory: different logical structures for solving problems.
- Computability theory: what is calculable with the current models of computers. Proofs developed by Alan Turing and others provide insight into the possibilities of what may be computed and what may not.
- Computational complexity theory: fundamental bounds (especially time and storage space) on classes of computations.
